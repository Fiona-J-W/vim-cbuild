INTRODUCTION                            *cbuild*

When working with cmake and ninje, this plugin searches
through all parent-folders and looks for one that is named
`build`. In that a subdirectory will be choosen by the user in
which `cmake ../..` and `ninja` are called.

It is the users task to make sure that the sub-directory exists
and that it already contains the desired cmake-configuration.



COMMANDS                                *cbuild-commands*

:cbuild [build_type]             Builds the project



VARIABLES                               *cbuild-variables*

g:cbuild_default_build_type      It identifies the subdirectory of
                                 the build-directory that will be
                                 used to build the project.

                                 If it isn't set, the default will
                                 be `"debug"`.
